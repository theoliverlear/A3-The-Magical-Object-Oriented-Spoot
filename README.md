| In this assignment, you will create a Java program to explore the concepts |
| of basic classes, constructors, getters, and setters. Instead of using     |
| real-world entities, you will design a class hierarchy representing        |
| imaginary creatures called Spoots. These Spoots will have specific         |
| attributes such as name, color and age. Your objective is to demonstrate   |
| your understanding of class design and object-oriented programming         |
| concepts by implementing the Spoot class.                                  |

<!-------------------------Introduction/Description-------------------------->
## Introduction
The Spoot is an amazing imaginary creature that can be many different names,
colors, and abilities. The Spoot is a magical creature that can be a good tool
for learning about object-oriented programming. The Spoot exists in a 
hierarchy of classes that can be used to show Java's ability to have 
independent and shared attributes. Please enjoy your visit to the Spoot 
Factory and perhaps you will find yourself understanding object-oriented
programming a little better.

limit. I chose to still include it in my README.md because it is a requirement
to a proper README.md.-->

```bash
cd your/desired/directory
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theoliverlear/A3-The-Magical-Object-Oriented-Spoot.git
```
<!--Maybe have mac, windows, and linux installation instructions?-->
