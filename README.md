| In this assignment, you will create a Java program to explore the concepts |
| of basic classes, constructors, getters, and setters. Instead of using     |
| real-world entities, you will design a class hierarchy representing        |
| imaginary creatures called Spoots. These Spoots will have specific         |
| attributes such as name, color and age. Your objective is to demonstrate   |
| your understanding of class design and object-oriented programming         |
| concepts by implementing the Spoot class.                                  |

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction - The Spoot Factory</h2>

The Spoot is an amazing imaginary creature that can have many different names,
colors, and abilities. The Spoot is a magical being that can be a good tool
for learning about object-oriented programming. The Spoot exists in a 
hierarchy of classes that can be used to show Java's ability to have 
independent and shared attributes. Please enjoy your visit to the Spoot 
Factory and perhaps you will find yourself understanding object-oriented
programming a little better by the end of your visit.

file which will execute the program. To run the program both locally and 
remotely, you will need to follow these instructions:

### 📁 Navigate to the Source Directory
```bash
cd your/desired/directory/A3-The-Magical-Object-Oriented-Spoot/src
```

One you've arrived in the 📁 directory `/src`, there will be a shell script 
called `run_spoot_factory.sh`. This shell script will execute the program. To
run the program, type the following commands into the console:
```bash
chmod +x run_spoot_factory.sh
```
... then finally enter:
```bash
./run_spoot_factory.sh
```

## 💻 Running the Program

✅ ***Success***: If you installed the program correctly, the program will 
launch and you will be greeted with a welcome message. The program will show
the contents of its operations and it will be obvious that the program is
running correctly. ✅

❎ ***Failure***: If you did not install the program correctly, you will be
given an error message. In this case, delete the downloaded content and 
restart from the beginning of the instructions. If issues continue, try again
with a different installation type. If you are still having trouble, please
💬 contact me via the contact information in the 📌 
<a href="#contributing">Contributing</a> section. ❎

---
### 📋 Using the Program
The program creates various Spoots and displays their attributes. The program
has Spoots with different names, colors, ages, and weights. The hierarchy of
classes bind the Spoots together and allow them to share attributes. The
subclasses of Spoot are more unique and have their own attributes. To better
understand object-oriented programming, you can read the code and see how the
classes are structured. Explore the program and see what you can find!

### 💡 Knowledge building questions:
- 💭 What is the core class of the program?
- 💭 Do subclasses add or remove content from their superclass?
- 💭 Why can private attributes be accessed by subclasses?
- 💭 What kind of hierarchies do Spoots relate to in the real world?

If you can answer these questions, then you are beginning to understand 
object-oriented programming. If you can't answer these questions, you will 
know what to 💡 study next. If you have any questions, please 💬 contact me
via the contact information in the 📌 
<a href="#contributing">Contributing</a> section. I would be happy to help you
understand how the program demonstrates object-oriented concepts.
