| In this assignment, you will create a Java program to explore the concepts |
| of basic classes, constructors, getters, and setters. Instead of using     |
| real-world entities, you will design a class hierarchy representing        |
| imaginary creatures called Spoots. These Spoots will have specific         |
| attributes such as name, color and age. Your objective is to demonstrate   |
| your understanding of class design and object-oriented programming         |
| concepts by implementing the Spoot class.                                  |
