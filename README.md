| In this assignment, you will create a Java program to explore the concepts |
| of basic classes, constructors, getters, and setters. Instead of using     |
| real-world entities, you will design a class hierarchy representing        |
| imaginary creatures called Spoots. These Spoots will have specific         |
| attributes such as name, color and age. Your objective is to demonstrate   |
| your understanding of class design and object-oriented programming         |
| concepts by implementing the Spoot class.                                  |

## Introduction - The Spoot Factory                <a name="introduction"></a>
The Spoot is an amazing imaginary creature that have be many different names,
colors, and abilities. The Spoot is a magical being that can be a good tool
for learning about object-oriented programming. The Spoot exists in a 
hierarchy of classes that can be used to show Java's ability to have 
independent and shared attributes. Please enjoy your visit to the Spoot 
Factory and perhaps you will find yourself understanding object-oriented
programming a little better by the end of your visit.

<!---------------------------Installation-Options---------------------------->
### 💻 **Local** or 🚀 **Remote** Usage 
The Spoot Factory can be used locally or remotely. If you would like to use
the Spoot Factory locally, you will need to install the program and read the
following instructions. If you would like to use the Spoot Factory remotely,
you can use the program on Replit. To use the Spoot Factory on Replit, please
read the 📌 [Replit](#replit) section.

### Local vs Remote Comparison
💻**Local** :
- ✅ Can be used without internet 
- ✅ Can be used without a Replit account 
- ⚠️ Requires installation and downloads
- ⚠️ More complicated to set up
  - ✏️ More customizable

🚀**Remote** :
- ✅ No installation or downloads 
- ✅ Usable on any device with a web browser 
- ⚠️ Requires internet
- ⚠️ Requires a Replit account
  - 🆓 Can be created for free

<!----------------------------Local-Installation----------------------------->
## 💻 Local Installation - Downloads 
Give a step-by-step guide on how to install your project. Be sure to include
prerequisites, download links, and examples of code to run. You will want to
have command installation instructions like:

### 💾 Prerequisites
_Click prerequisite to go to the download page..._

***To download this program, you will need:***
- 🔗 [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

***To run this program, you will need:***
- 🔗 [Java 8 or higher](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)

Download and install the prerequisites before continuing. You will need to
choose the correct download for your operating system. You may need to restart
your computer after installing the prerequisites. Do this before continuing 
and you will be ready to install the program.

<!-------------------------Installation-Command-Line------------------------->
## 💻 Complete Installation - ⚠️ Command Line

The final step for installing the program to use the **_command line_**. The
command line is a powerful and equally dangerous tool. Only use the command
line as instructed. There can be 🚩 **_irreversible damage_** 🚩 done to your 
computer if you misuse your terminal.

<!--There was no possible way to make the link not surpass the 79 character
limit. I chose to still include it in my README.md because it is a requirement
to a proper README.md.-->

```bash
cd your/desired/directory
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theoliverlear/A3-The-Magical-Object-Oriented-Spoot.git
```
<!--Maybe have mac, windows, and linux installation instructions?-->

---

The Java files are already compiled and ready to run. To run the program,
please follow these instructions:

```bash
cd your/desired/directory/A3-The-Magical-Object-Oriented-Spoot/src
```

```bash
java SpootFactory
```

If you installed the program correctly, the program will launch and you will
be greeted with a welcome message. If you did not install the program
correctly, you will be given an error message.

<!----------------------------------Replit----------------------------------->
## 🚀 Replit - Remote Installation                       <a name="replit"></a>
Replit is an online IDE that allows you to run programs in the cloud. This 
means the Spoot Factory will run the program remotely through the internet and
in your browser. This way you do not need to install the program locally or
download any files. To use the Spoot Factory on Replit, please follow these
instructions:

### Prerequisites
***To run this program remotely on Replit:***
- Create a 🔗 [Replit Account](https://replit.com/signup)
  - This is free and only requires an email address
  - You can sign up with an email, Google, or GitHub account
- Naviage to the 🔗 [program]()

  - You will need to be logged into your Replit account to access the program

<!-----------------------------------Usage----------------------------------->
## Usage                                                  <a name="usage"></a>
This is where you will explain how to use the software. What does it do? How
will the user interact with it? What is the expected output? 

To run the Spoot program, please follow these instructions:
To execute run_spoot_factory.sh, type into the console 
```chmod +x run_spoot_factory.sh```
and then
```./run_spoot_factory.sh.```
If you installed the program correctly, the program will launch and you will
be greeted with a welcome message. If you did not install the program
correctly, you will be given an error message.

<!-----------------------------------Note------------------------------------>
### A note from the author:
> This has been a wonderful semester and I can actually say that I have 
> learned a lot. I have learned about style, documentation, and what it means
> to be a programmer. I have learned about flexibility and how to adapt to
> projects that are not what I expected. I have learned about the importance
> of approaching every assignment, no matter how small, with the same level of
> care and attention to detail that I have with my personal projects. When you
> do, you get something out of it you wouldn't have otherwise. I look forward
> to the upcoming fall semester and with that, I am...

**Signing off,**
