/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| In this assignment, you will create a Java program to explore the concepts |
| of basic classes, constructors, getters, and setters. Instead of using     |
| real-world entities, you will design a class hierarchy representing        |
| imaginary creatures called Spoots. These Spoots will have specific         |
| attributes such as name, color and age. Your objective is to demonstrate   |
| your understanding of class design and object-oriented programming         |
| concepts by implementing the Spoot class.                                  |

// TODO: Imagine different Spoots. They will relate to
//       each other through their shared attribues of
//       their superclasses. They will also be unique
//       in their own ways and how they may interpret
//       their superclasses' attributes.

// Idea 1: Essence Spoot (Abstract class???)
//         Essence Spoots are the most basic Spoots.
//         They are like ghosts or phantoms. These
//         Spoots may rank higher on the hierarchy
//         than other Spoots because they are mostly
//         the soul of a Spoot and they have
//         transcended the physical realm.
